# SQL Data Analytics Project

A comprehensive collection of SQL scripts for data exploration, analytics, and reporting. These scripts cover various analyses such as:
- Database exploration
- Measures and metrics
- Time-based trends
- Cumulative analytics
- Segmentation

## 📊 Datasets
The datasets used in this project originate from a separate project on my GitHub: **sql_data_warehouse_project**. That project focuses on data warehousing, while this repository is dedicated to data analytics. The data used here comes from the **bronze, silver, and gold layers** of the processed datasets, which have been prepared and optimized for analysis.
